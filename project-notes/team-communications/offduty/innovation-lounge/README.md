# ðŸ’¡ Innovation Lounge - Creative Thinking & Informal Ideation

## ðŸŒŸ **ROOM PURPOSE**
The Innovation Lounge is our creative sanctuary for brainstorming, informal ideation, experimental thinking, and breakthrough innovation. This is where constraints are lifted, creativity flows freely, and impossible ideas become possible solutions.
