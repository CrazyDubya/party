# ShellGPT

## Overview
ShellGPT is an open-source command-line interface (CLI) AI coding assistant that integrates with various Large Language Models (LLMs), primarily OpenAI's GPT models. It allows users to generate and execute shell commands, write code snippets, summarize text, and perform other AI-assisted tasks directly in the terminal.

## Agentic/AI Capabilities
*   **Core AI Feature:** Command generation and execution, code generation, text summarization and analysis, code explanation, Git integration (commit messages).
*   **No-Code/Low-Code Approach:** Interacts via natural language prompts in the terminal.
*   **Integration with LLMs/AI Services:** Integrates with OpenAI's GPT models (GPT-4, GPT-4o), and can be configured to use other LLMs, including local models via Ollama.
*   **Use Cases:** Generating shell commands, writing code snippets (Bash, Python), summarizing text, analyzing data, processing logs, auto-generating Git commit messages, cybersecurity applications.

## Pricing Model
*   **General Model:** Free (open-source). Costs come from underlying LLM API usage.
*   **Key Cost Factors:** LLM API usage (token consumption). Can be free with local LLMs.
*   **Example Pricing:** Dependent on the chosen LLM API.

## Key Features
*   **Visual Builder:** No (CLI-based).
*   **Integrations:** Various LLMs, Git.
*   **Scalability:** Designed for individual developers.
*   **Deployment Options:** Runs locally in the terminal.
*   **Monitoring & Analytics:** Not explicitly detailed in search results.
*   **Security:** Not explicitly detailed in search results, but local operation implies data stays on user's machine.
*   **Support & Community:** Open-source, community support.

## Pros & Cons
*   **Pros:**
    *   Free and open-source.
    *   Operates locally, keeping code on the user's machine.
    *   Flexible LLM integration (including local models).
    *   Cross-platform compatibility.
    *   Useful for command generation and code snippets.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Costs depend on external LLM API usage.
    *   Requires technical setup for LLM integration.
