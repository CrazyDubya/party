# Midjourney

## Overview
Midjourney is a popular AI image generation service known for its high-quality and artistic outputs. It operates through a Discord bot and offers tiered subscription plans based on GPU usage, with specific commercial usage rights for paid subscribers.

## Models/Technology Used
*   Midjourney V6 (and previous versions)

## Pricing Model
*   **General Model:** Tiered subscription plans (Basic, Standard, Pro, Mega) based on "Fast GPU time" (fast hours). Annual subscription offers a 20% discount. No free tier or trial.
*   **Key Cost Factors:** Fast GPU hours consumed, concurrent jobs.
*   **Example Pricing:**
    *   **Basic Plan:** $10/month or $96/year (~3.3 GPU hours/month, ~200 images in fast mode).
    *   **Standard Plan:** $30/month or $288/year (15 GPU hours/month, ~900 images in fast mode).
    *   **Pro Plan:** $60/month or $576/year (30 GPU hours/month, ~1,800 images in fast mode).
    *   **Mega Plan:** $120/month or $1,152/year (60 GPU hours/month, ~3,600 images in fast mode).

## Commercial Usage Rights
*   **Paid Subscribers:** Generally permitted for commercial use.
*   **Free Users:** Prohibited from commercial use (CC BY-NC 4.0 license).
*   **Companies > $1M Revenue:** Must subscribe to Pro or Mega plan for commercial use.

## Limits & Rate Completions
