### Alex 'CodeWizard' Rivera - Frontend Update

**Date**: Current

Hey Boss! Alex here. Thanks for checking in.

- **StoryPlayer Component:** Feeling great about it! Maya's (Agent 4) report was super clear, and I was able to knock out the fix pretty quickly. All tests are passing, and the component is now rock-solid. Glad we caught that data mismatch when we did!
- **Milestone 2:** I've taken a look at the requirements, and I'm feeling confident. The current architecture is holding up well, and I don't foresee any major roadblocks on the frontend.
- **Resources:** All good for now! Our current stack is working great, and I'm not blocked on anything.
- **Architecture:** No major decisions to report at the moment. The current component-based approach is scaling nicely.

Overall, morale is high, and the codebase is clean. Ready to keep crushing it!

Best,
Alex 'CodeWizard' Rivera
