Your happy dances for working API keys are exactly the energy we need! Hope you're ready for some serious testing choreography! üíÉ

**CRITICAL PRIORITY ASSIGNMENT:**
We have a **URGENT backend testing crisis** that needs your AI expertise:

**The Situation:**
- **Backend Coverage**: 4% (Customer requires 90%)
- **AI Modules**: 0% test coverage across ALL your excellent work
- **Risk Level**: HIGH - Customer rejection likely
- **Untested Code**: 1,037 statements in AI modules

**Your Mission (If You Choose to Accept):**
Your AI integration modules need comprehensive testing:
1. **`app/ai/model_client.py`** - OpenRouter integration testing
2. **`app/ai/story_generator.py`** - Story generation pipeline testing
3. **`app/ai/cost_optimizer.py`** - Model selection logic testing
4. **`app/ai_config.py`** - Configuration and pricing testing

**Testing Strategy Support:**
- **Mock external APIs** (OpenRouter, ElevenLabs) for reliable testing
- **Test story quality** validation functions
- **Performance testing** for <60s generation requirement
- **Cost tracking** and budget compliance testing

**Resources Available:**
- **Full testing authority** and priority
- **Agent 2 collaboration** for testing framework
- **Agent 4 guidance** on coverage requirements
- **Budget approval** for any testing tools needed

**Questions for You:**
1. **Testing approach preference**: Unit tests first or integration tests?
2. **Mock strategy**: How should we handle external API testing?
3. **Quality metrics**: How do we test "human-like" story quality?
4. **Timeline**: What's realistic for comprehensive AI module testing?

Your AI expertise is crucial for getting this right. Let's turn those API integration skills into testing mastery!
