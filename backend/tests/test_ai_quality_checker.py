As she ventured deeper, she noticed strange symbols carved into the bark of an enormous oak tree. The symbols seemed to glow faintly in the dappled sunlight, beckoning her to come closer. Sarah reached out to touch the mysterious markings, feeling a tingling sensation in her fingertips. Suddenly, she heard voices approaching from behind.

One carried a staff topped with a crystal that pulsed with blue energy, while the other held what appeared to be an ancient tome bound in leather. 'The signs were correct, Marcus,' the first figure said in a melodious voice. 'The chosen one has finally arrived.' Sarah's breath caught in her throat. Were they talking about her? How could they possibly know she was here? The second figure, presumably Marcus, nodded solemnly. 'Then we must proceed carefully. The prophecy speaks of great power, but also great danger.'
