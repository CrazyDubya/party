# Aider

## Overview
Aider is an open-source CLI AI coding assistant that functions as an AI pair programmer directly within your terminal. It helps developers with code generation, modification, and debugging across multiple languages, integrating with Git and offering flexibility in choosing underlying LLMs.

## Agentic/AI Capabilities
*   **Core AI Feature:** AI pair programming, codebase mapping, multi-file editing, code generation, debugging, code review, automated linting/testing fixes.
*   **No-Code/Low-Code Approach:** Interacts via natural language commands in the terminal. Changes can be requested by adding comments in code editor.
*   **Integration with LLMs/AI Services:** Connects to Claude, OpenAI (o1, o3-mini, GPT-4o), DeepSeek (R1 & Chat V3), and local models (Ollama, LM Studio).
*   **Use Cases:** New project setup, adding features, refactoring, bug fixes, test case generation, code completion, language translation, web search integration.

## Pricing Model
*   **General Model:** Free (open-source). Costs come from underlying LLM API usage.
*   **Key Cost Factors:** LLM API usage (token consumption). Can be free with local LLMs.
*   **Example Pricing:** As low as $0.007 per file processed (dependent on LLM API costs).

## Key Features
*   **Visual Builder:** No (CLI-based).
*   **Integrations:** Git, various LLM APIs, local LLMs, web search.
*   **Scalability:** Designed for individual developers and teams.
*   **Deployment Options:** Runs locally in the terminal.
*   **Monitoring & Analytics:** Automatically tracks AI changes and creates descriptive Git commit messages.
*   **Security:** Not explicitly detailed in search results, but local operation implies data stays on user's machine.
*   **Support & Community:** Open-source, community support.

## Pros & Cons
*   **Pros:**
    *   Free and open-source.
    *   Operates locally, keeping code on the user's machine.
    *   Flexible LLM integration (including local models for cost savings).
    *   Strong Git integration.
    *   Supports a wide range of programming languages.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Costs depend on external LLM API usage.
