# Redis Cloud

## Overview
Redis Cloud offers a fully managed Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) that provides the speed and reliability of Redis in the cloud. It is integrated with major cloud providers and extends Redis functionality through various modules for multi-model capabilities, excelling in caching and real-time GenAI applications.

## Database Types Supported
*   Redis (in-memory key-value store)
*   Cache
*   Vector Database
*   Document Store (RedisJSON)
*   Time Series Database (RedisTimeSeries)
*   Graph Database
*   Probabilistic Data Structures (RedisBloom)
*   Geospatial Indexes

## Pricing Model
*   **General Model:** Tiered pricing (Essentials, Flex, Pro), usage-based, annual plans. Free tier available.
*   **Key Cost Factors:** Storage (RAM + SSD), concurrent connections, dedicated vs. shared deployment, features (e.g., Active-Active, auto-tiering).
*   **Example Pricing:**
    *   **Essentials Free Tier:** 30MB storage, 30 concurrent connections (for training and prototyping).
    *   **Essentials:** Storage from 250MB to 12GB.
    *   **Flex:** Shared cloud deployment, 1-100 GB (RAM + SSD).
    *   **Pro:** Dedicated cloud deployment, 6 GB RAM and up.

## Key Features
*   **Managed Service:** Yes (fully managed).
