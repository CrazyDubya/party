# AI Chat (aichat)

## Overview
AI Chat (aichat) is an open-source, all-in-one command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) directly into your terminal workflow. It provides interactive chat, shell assistance, code assistance, and RAG capabilities, connecting to a wide range of LLM platforms.

## Agentic/AI Capabilities
*   **Core AI Feature:** Interactive chat-REPL, shell assistant (natural language to shell commands), code assistant (pair programming, code generation), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), AI Tools & Agents, image analysis.
*   **No-Code/Low-Code Approach:** Interacts via natural language prompts in the terminal.
*   **Integration with LLMs/AI Services:** Connects to over 20 LLM platforms (GPT-3.5/4, Gemini, Claude-3, Mistral, Cohere, Perplexity, Groq, OpenAI, Ollama, Azure-OpenAI, VertexAI, Bedrock, Huggingface).
*   **Use Cases:** Generating shell commands, code snippets, chatting with LLMs, integrating external documents for context, defining AI Agents with tools and documents.

## Pricing Model
*   **General Model:** Free (open-source). Costs come from underlying LLM API usage.
*   **Key Cost Factors:** LLM API usage (token consumption).
*   **Example Pricing:** Dependent on the chosen LLM API.

## Key Features
*   **Visual Builder:** No (CLI-based, but solutions can be exposed via a web UI playground).
*   **Integrations:** Over 20 LLM platforms, local files, directories, remote URLs.
*   **Scalability:** Designed for individual developers.
*   **Deployment Options:** Runs locally in the terminal. Solutions can be exposed via API and web UI.
*   **Monitoring & Analytics:** Not explicitly detailed in search results.
*   **Security:** Not explicitly detailed in search results, but local operation implies data stays on user's machine.
*   **Support & Community:** Open-source, actively maintained, well-documented.
