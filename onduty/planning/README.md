## Planning Tools

### 📈 **Decision Framework**
When evaluating new features or approaches:
1. **Real User Value**: Does this improve the story experience?
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Can we maintain our cost targets?
3. **Technical Feasibility**: Do we have research/capability?
4. **Quality Impact**: Will this maintain our quality standards?
5. **Development Effort**: Is the ROI worth the investment?

### 🎲 **Risk Assessment**
- **API Dependencies**: Mitigated by multi-provider strategy
