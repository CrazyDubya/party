# QA Agent Instructions

**Branch:** `feature/testing-qa`

**Tasks:**

1.  Create a new feature branch named `feature/testing-qa`.
2.  Configure the frontend and backend testing frameworks (Vitest and pytest) to generate coverage reports.
3.  Write initial unit tests for the existing frontend and backend code.
4.  Set up a basic end-to-end (E2E) testing framework using a tool like Playwright or Cypress.
5.  Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the root of the project that outlines the testing requirements for all new code.
6.  Aim for 10% test coverage in this initial setup phase. The goal is to establish the testing infrastructure.
