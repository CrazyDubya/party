# CRITICAL SETUP CHECKLIST - AGENT 5 PROJECT MANAGER

## BLOCKING ISSUES (MUST RESOLVE IMMEDIATELY)

### üî¥ CRITICAL - Repository Setup
- [ ] **CREATE GITHUB REPO "party"** - Customer must do this first
- [ ] Push all branches to GitHub
- [ ] Set up branch protection rules
- [ ] Configure team access

### üü° HIGH PRIORITY - Development Environment  
- [ ] Backend Python environment (python3 detected)
- [ ] Frontend dependencies (‚úÖ installed)
- [ ] Testing frameworks validation
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline activation

### üü¢ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Quality Infrastructure
- [ ] 90% test coverage baseline
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Code quality automation

## AGENT COORDINATION NEEDS

### Agent 1 (Frontend) - READY TO WORK
- Has Svelte environment set up
- Needs GitHub repo to create feature branches
- Must expand UI components and tests

### Agent 2 (Backend) - NEEDS PYTHON SETUP
- Python3 available, venv creation in progress
- FastAPI structure exists
- Needs database models completion

### Agent 3 (AI Integration) - WAITING FOR APIS
- Only agent with internet access
- Needs OpenRouter API keys
- Must integrate real AI generation

### Agent 4 (Testing) - CRITICAL BLOCKER
- Must achieve 90% coverage immediately
- Current tests insufficient for customer requirements
- Performance testing not yet implemented

## CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS STATUS

‚ùå **90% test coverage** - Currently insufficient
‚ùå **GitHub workflow** - No repo exists yet  
‚ùå **Performance validation** - Not tested
‚úÖ **Basic structure** - Complete
‚úÖ **Tech stack** - Properly configured

## IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

1. **Customer creates GitHub repo "party"**
2. **Push code to GitHub** 
3. **Agent 4 expands test coverage to 90%**
4. **Agent 3 sets up AI API integration**
5. **All agents create feature branches and begin work**

## RISK LEVEL: HIGH
Without GitHub repo, team cannot coordinate effectively. Customer's strict requirements mean any deviation results in rejection.
