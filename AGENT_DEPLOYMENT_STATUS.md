- [x] Project structure and dependencies in place
- [x] CI/CD pipeline configured

## 🚨 CRITICAL REMAINING TASKS

### Agent 4 (Testing Specialist) - URGENT
**Status**: Must achieve 90% test coverage immediately
**Blocker**: Frontend tests currently failing
**Action**: Load `agents/agent4_testing_specialist.md` and fix test framework

### Agent 1 (Frontend Developer) - READY
**Status**: Can begin work on feature branch
**Action**: Load `agents/frontend-agent-instructions.md` and create `feature/ui-polish`

### Agent 3 (AI Integration) - WAITING FOR APIS
**Status**: Needs OpenRouter API setup
**Action**: Load `agents/ai-agent-instructions.md` and set up external integrations

## MILESTONE 1 COMPLETION CHECKLIST

### Remaining Tasks for Week 1 → dev:
- [ ] **Agent 4**: Fix test framework and achieve 90% coverage
- [ ] **Agent 1**: Polish UI responsiveness and add components
- [ ] **Agent 3**: Set up mock AI responses with real API structure
- [ ] **Agent 4**: Performance baseline testing (<60s, <2s load)
- [ ] **All**: Create feature branches and submit PRs

## CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS TRACKING
- ✅ Repository setup with proper branching
- ✅ Svelte frontend shell
- ✅ FastAPI backend (Agent 2 complete)
- ❌ **90% test coverage** (CRITICAL - Agent 4)
- ❌ **Performance validation** (Agent 4)
- ❌ **UI polish** (Agent 1)

## AGENT COORDINATION PROTOCOL
1. **Agent 4** - Fix tests FIRST (blocking all other work)
2. **Agent 1** - Create `feature/ui-polish` branch from dev
3. **Agent 3** - Create `feature/ai-integration` branch from dev
4. **All agents** - Submit PRs to dev with proper reviews
5. **Project Manager** - Coordinate milestone completion

## RISK ASSESSMENT
- **HIGH**: Test coverage failure = customer rejection
- **MEDIUM**: Performance not yet validated
- **LOW**: Basic structure complete, Agent 2 done

## SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR MILESTONE 1
- 90% test coverage maintained
- Story generation mock refined
- UI responsive and polished
- Performance baseline established
- All work on feature branches with proper PRs
