# GPT Pilot

## Overview
GPT Pilot is an open-source AI-powered collaborative software development platform designed to generate production-ready applications with minimal human intervention. It employs a multi-agent approach to systematically break down and implement software development tasks, aiming to automate a significant portion of the coding process.

## Agentic/AI Capabilities
*   **Core AI Feature:** Autonomous app generation, multi-agent architecture (Product Owner, Software Architect, Developer, etc.), context rewinding, recursive conversations, Test-Driven Development (TDD).
*   **No-Code/Low-Code Approach:** Interacts via CLI commands.
*   **Integration with LLMs/AI Services:** Supports various LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq).
*   **Use Cases:** Generating fully functional applications, automating coding processes, debugging, orchestrating workflows.

## Pricing Model
*   **General Model:** Free (open-source, Fair Source License). Costs come from underlying LLM API usage.
*   **Key Cost Factors:** LLM API usage (token consumption).
*   **Example Pricing:** Dependent on the chosen LLM API. One user reported $33 for a medium-low sized project using GPT-4.

## Key Features
*   **Visual Builder:** No (CLI-based).
*   **Integrations:** Docker, PostgreSQL, various LLMs.
*   **Scalability:** Designed for large, production-ready applications.
*   **Deployment Options:** Runs via Docker.
*   **Monitoring & Analytics:** Real debugging tools (error logs, breakpoints, step-through debugging).
*   **Security:** Not explicitly detailed in search results, but code ownership is retained by users.
*   **Support & Community:** Open-source, community support. Pythagora (developer) offers paid platform plans with additional features and support.

## Pros & Cons
*   **Pros:**
    *   Free and open-source.
    *   Automates a significant portion of the coding process.
    *   Multi-agent architecture for systematic development.
    *   Supports various LLMs.
    *   Focus on production-ready applications.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Costs depend on external LLM API usage.
    *   Requires technical setup for deployment.
    *   Still requires developer oversight.
