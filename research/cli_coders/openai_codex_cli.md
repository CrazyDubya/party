# OpenAI Codex CLI

## Overview
OpenAI Codex CLI is an open-source command-line tool that integrates OpenAI's AI models (like `o4-mini` and `o3`) directly into your terminal. It allows users to understand, generate, and modify code on their local machine through natural language, with various levels of automation and approval workflows.

## Agentic/AI Capabilities
*   **Core AI Feature:** AI-assisted coding, code generation, code modification, intelligent code completion, natural language to code translation, code translation between languages, debugging, code review.
*   **No-Code/Low-Code Approach:** Interacts via natural language commands in the terminal.
*   **Integration with LLMs/AI Services:** Uses OpenAI's `codex-1` (based on `o3`) and `o4-mini` models.
*   **Use Cases:** Writing features, answering codebase questions, running tests, proposing pull requests, fixing bugs, generating documentation, finding libraries, adding comments, rewriting code.

## Pricing Model
*   **General Model:** API usage-based.
*   **Key Cost Factors:** Token consumption (input and output).
*   **Example Pricing:**
    *   `codex-mini` (for faster responses): $1.50 per 1 million input tokens, $6 per 1 million output tokens.
    *   Typical code change tasks using `o3` model: ~$3â€“4.
    *   OpenAI offers grants (up to $25,000 in API credits) for open-source projects.

## Key Features
*   **Visual Builder:** No (CLI-based).
*   **Integrations:** GitHub, local repository, various services (Mailchimp, Microsoft Word, Spotify, Google Calendar via cloud agent).
*   **Scalability:** Designed for individual developers and teams.
*   **Deployment Options:** Runs locally in the terminal. Cloud-based OpenAI Codex agent is available for ChatGPT subscribers.
*   **Monitoring & Analytics:** Provides verifiable evidence of actions through terminal logs and test outputs.
*   **Security:** Operates within a sandboxed, network-disabled environment (for Full Auto mode). `codex-1` model designed to refuse malware/policy violations.
*   **Support & Community:** Open-source, community support.

## Pros & Cons
*   **Pros:**
    *   Operates locally, keeping source code on the user's machine.
    *   Flexible approval workflows (Suggest, Auto Edit, Full Auto).
    *   Supports multiple programming languages.
    *   Can handle complex code changes.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Pricing is API usage-based, which can be unpredictable.
    *   Requires API key and understanding of token consumption.
    *   Cloud-based agent access is tied to ChatGPT subscriptions.
