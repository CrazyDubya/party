# PROJECT STATUS - AGENT 5 COORDINATION

## CRITICAL SCAFFOLDING NEEDS

### 1. REPOSITORY SETUP (URGENT)
- [ ] Create GitHub repository "party" 
- [ ] Push all branches (main, dev, staging, production)
- [ ] Set branch protection rules
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline

### 2. AGENT COORDINATION INFRASTRUCTURE
- [ ] GitHub Issues for task tracking
- [ ] Project board for milestone visibility
- [ ] Branch naming conventions enforcement
- [ ] PR review assignments

### 3. DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
- [ ] Frontend dependencies verified (âœ… DONE)
- [ ] Backend virtual environment setup
- [ ] Testing framework validation
- [ ] Local development scripts

### 4. QUALITY GATES
- [ ] 90% test coverage baseline
- [ ] Performance benchmarking setup
- [ ] Code quality checks (Prettier, Black)
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks

### 5. MILESTONE 1 COMPLETION BLOCKERS
- [ ] Expanded test coverage (currently insufficient)
- [ ] UI responsiveness testing
- [ ] Mock story generation refinement
- [ ] Performance baseline establishment

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

1. **Customer**: Create GitHub repo "party" 
2. **Agent 3 (AI)**: Set up OpenRouter API integration
3. **Agent 4 (Testing)**: Achieve 90% coverage baseline
4. **Agent 1 (Frontend)**: Polish UI and add responsiveness
5. **Agent 2 (Backend)**: Enhance API endpoints and data models

## RISK ASSESSMENT
- **HIGH**: No GitHub repo = no team coordination
- **HIGH**: Insufficient test coverage = customer rejection
- **MEDIUM**: Performance not yet validated
- **LOW**: Dependencies and basic structure in place

## CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION
Customer requirements are STRICT:
- 90% test coverage or rejection
- <60s story generation or failure  
- Stories must feel human, not chatbot-like
- Follow process exactly or start over
