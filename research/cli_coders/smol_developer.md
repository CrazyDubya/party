# smol developer

## Overview
smol developer is a free and open-source AI coding assistant that functions as an AI agent builder. It can generate entire codebases from concise natural language prompts, acting as a "junior developer" for rapid prototyping and bootstrapping new projects.

## Agentic/AI Capabilities
*   **Core AI Feature:** AI agent builder, codebase scaffolding, whole program synthesis, AI-powered code suggestions, real-time code analysis, intelligent code refactoring.
*   **No-Code/Low-Code Approach:** Generates codebases from natural language prompts.
*   **Integration with LLMs/AI Services:** Leverages LLMs (e.g., OpenAI's chat completions) via a Python script.
*   **Use Cases:** Rapid prototyping, bootstrapping new projects, generating boilerplate code, automating code suggestions, code analysis.

## Pricing Model
*   **General Model:** Free (open-source). Costs come from underlying LLM API usage.
*   **Key Cost Factors:** LLM API usage (token consumption).
*   **Example Pricing:** Dependent on the chosen LLM API.

## Key Features
*   **Visual Builder:** No (CLI-based).
*   **Integrations:** LLM endpoints (e.g., OpenAI), GitHub.
*   **Scalability:** Designed for individual developers and small teams.
*   **Deployment Options:** Runs from the command line.
*   **Monitoring & Analytics:** Not explicitly detailed in search results.
*   **Security:** Not explicitly detailed in search results, but local operation implies data stays on user's machine.
*   **Support & Community:** Open-source, community support.

## Pros & Cons
*   **Pros:**
    *   Free and open-source.
    *   Generates entire codebases from prompts.
    *   Simple and customizable codebase.
    *   Supports various programming languages and frameworks.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Costs depend on external LLM API usage.
    *   Requires technical setup for LLM integration.
    *   "Junior developer" capabilities may require iterative refinement.
