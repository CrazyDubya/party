## Key Features
*   **API Endpoints:** Production-ready APIs for LLMs, image/video generation, and speech.
*   **Pricing Model:** Pay-as-you-go, token-based pricing for LLMs. Also offers GPU Spot Instances (e.g., RTX 4090 24GB for $0.18/hr) and image generation ($0.0015 per standard image).
*   **Caching:** Not explicitly mentioned in the search results.
*   **Rate Limits:** Implemented to ensure fair resource allocation. Primarily measured in IPM (Images Per Minute) for image models and RPM (Requests Per Minute) for video models. Specific LLM rate limits are not detailed but can be increased upon request.
*   **Supported Modalities:** Text (LLMs), Image, Video, Speech.
*   **Developer Tools/SDKs:** Not explicitly mentioned.
*   **Unique Selling Propositions:** Multimodal platform, cost-effective, stable, scalable, low latency, GPU Spot Instances.

## Pros & Cons
*   **Pros:**
    *   Comprehensive multimodal AI platform.
    *   Transparent and competitive token-based pricing.
    *   Offers access to a wide range of LLMs and other AI models.
    *   GPU Spot Instances for cost-effective compute.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Specific details on caching and output size limits are not readily available in the search results.
    *   Some pricing details might require direct inquiry.
